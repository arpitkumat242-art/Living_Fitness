🧬 Living_Fitness

Living_Fitness is an experimental, motion-first fitness website that behaves like a living organism rather than a static interface.

Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project explores how motion, rhythm, and interaction can communicate energy, fatigue, and recovery — just like the human body.

✨ Concept

Most fitness websites focus on visuals and hype.
Living_Fitness focuses on behavior.

The interface:

🫁 Breathes in response to user interaction

🫀 Pulses with scroll intensity

🧠 Adapts its motion based on how the user navigates

🛌 Slows down to simulate fatigue and recovery

The goal was to design motion that feels biological, not mechanical.

🛠 Tech Stack

HTML5 – Semantic, single-page structure

CSS3 – Custom properties, keyframe animations, responsive system

JavaScript (Vanilla) – Scroll physics, motion logic, adaptive behavior

No frameworks. No libraries. Just fundamentals.

🎯 Key Features

Breathing Hero Section
Subtle inhale–exhale animation that reacts to scroll speed.

Scroll-Based Motion Physics
Inertia and damping create weight and resistance in transitions.

Adaptive Interface
Calm scrolling results in smoother motion; aggressive scrolling introduces heavier resistance.

Heartbeat System
A pulse that intensifies as the user moves deeper into the experience.

Fatigue & Recovery State
Motion slows, colors soften, and actions require intentional interaction.

Performance-First Animations
Optimized for smooth 60fps with graceful motion reduction on low-end devices.

🚀 Getting Started

Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/your-username/living_fitness.git


Open index.html in your browser
(No build step required)

🧠 Learnings

Motion can communicate emotion and intent, not just decoration

Small timing changes make animations feel human

Scroll behavior is a powerful input, not just navigation

Vanilla JS is more than enough for expressive motion when used thoughtfully

🔮 Future Improvements

Accessibility refinements for motion sensitivity

Enhanced adaptive behavior based on session duration

Optional ambient sound design for heartbeat & breath
